# Microservices-Patient-Management
Microservices Based Patient Management System.



This is a comprehensive **Spring Boot Microservices** project simulating a **Healthcare Management System**, where microservices like **Patient Service**, **Billing Service**, **Analytics Service**, **Auth Service**, and an **API Gateway** are integrated using modern practices like **gRPC**, **Kafka**, **Docker**, **OpenAPI**, and **AWS** infrastructure provisioning via **CloudFormation**.

## üìñ Project Overview

This application is designed to demonstrate how to build and scale a real-world enterprise microservices system using:

- Spring Boot for service creation
- gRPC for synchronous service communication
- Kafka for asynchronous communication and event-driven architecture
- Docker for containerization
- API Gateway for centralized routing and authentication
- JWT for authentication and authorization
- AWS CloudFormation for Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Integration testing using Spring's testing framework

## üìÅ Microservices Breakdown

### üßç Patient Service
- REST endpoints to manage patient records
- Validations, exception handling
- Produces Kafka events for analytics
- Consumes gRPC Billing Service

### üí≥ Billing Service
- gRPC server to handle billing requests
- Interacts with Patient Service via gRPC

### üìä Analytics Service
- Kafka consumer
- Processes patient events for analytics
- Stores analytics records (or logs for now)

### üîê Auth Service
- Manages login and JWT generation
- Integration with API Gateway for route protection

### üåê API Gateway
- Central entrypoint for all external requests
- Routes traffic to underlying services
- Validates JWTs via Auth Service

---

## üß™ Testing
- Unit tests for services and controllers
- Integration tests for Auth and Patient modules

---

## üö¢ Deployment
- Docker Compose for local containerization
- LocalStack to emulate AWS locally
- CloudFormation for provisioning:
  - VPC
  - ECS Cluster
  - MSK (Kafka)
  - Load Balanced API Gateway
